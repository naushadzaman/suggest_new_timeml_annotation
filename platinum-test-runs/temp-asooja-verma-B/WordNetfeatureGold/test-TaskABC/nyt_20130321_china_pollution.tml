<TITLE>As Pollution Worsens in China, Solutions Succumb to Infighting</TITLE>

<TEXT>

China's state leadership <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">transition</EVENT> has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> place this month against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 dead pigs have been <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">floating</EVENT> in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">causing</EVENT> convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">forced</EVENT> to openly <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">acknowledge</EVENT> them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">checked</EVENT> for smog every morning after <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">opening</EVENT> her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him "quite upset" and <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">vowed</EVENT> to "<EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> even greater <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">resolve</EVENT> and make more vigorous efforts" to clean it up.

Last month, after deadly air pollution <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> record levels in northern China, officials <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION">order</EVENT> for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">orders</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">upgrade</EVENT> coal-burning electricity plants, <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_STATE">exert</EVENT> an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">discussions</EVENT> over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">policies</EVENT> would <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">result</EVENT> in an enormous <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">surge</EVENT> in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. "China's air pollution will <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> a lot worse from the already unbearable level," the analysts <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">calling</EVENT> for drastic policy changes and "a strong government will to <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">overcome</EVENT> the opposition from interest groups."

The report <EVENT eid="e30" class="I_ACTION">estimated</EVENT> that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> 400 million by 2030, up from 90 million now.
