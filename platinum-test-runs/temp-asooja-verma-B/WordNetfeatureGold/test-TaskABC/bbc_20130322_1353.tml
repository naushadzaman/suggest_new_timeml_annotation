<TITLE>Israel PM apologies for Gaza flotilla deaths</TITLE>

<TEXT>

Israel's prime minister has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">apologised</EVENT> to Turkey for "any errors that could have <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">loss</EVENT> of life" during the 2010 commando raid on an aid flotilla that <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">tried</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION">breach</EVENT> the Gaza blockade.

Benjamin Netanyahu also agreed with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">compensate</EVENT> the families of the nine activists who were <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT>.

Mr Netanyahu had previously only expressed regret for the <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">deaths</EVENT>.

The <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">deal</EVENT> was brokered by US President Barack Obama during a visit to Israel.

Mr Erdogan's office said he had accepted the apology, "in the name of the Turkish people".

In the past, he has always given two conditions for restoring bilateral relations with Israel <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE">-</EVENT> an apology and compensation for victims' families.

Nine people were <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> on board the Turkish aid <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">ship</EVENT>, Mavi Marmara, when it was boarded by Israeli commandos while <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_ACTION">trying</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">transport</EVENT> aid supplies to Gaza in May 2010 in spite of an Israeli naval <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">blockade</EVENT>.

The Israeli government admitted mistakes were <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> in intelligence-gathering and <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">planning</EVENT>, but <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION">insisted</EVENT> its commandos used lethal force because activists had <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">attacked</EVENT> them.

The activists <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the troops had <EVENT eid="e21" class="ASPECTUAL">opened</EVENT> fire as soon as they boarded the vessel, which was in international waters at the time.

The incident <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">provoked</EVENT> an international outcry and <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> to a major deterioration in relations between Turkey and Israel.

Before <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">departing</EVENT> for Jordan on Friday afternoon, Mr Obama <EVENT eid="e25" class="REPORTING">revealed</EVENT> that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Erdogan <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> just spoken by telephone.
