<TITLE>How Obama has weaponized wit</TITLE>


<TEXT>
Barack Obama would <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> a great stand-up comic, not because he's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do: as a weapon.

Traditionally, the (intentionally) funny lines by our presidents have <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">had</EVENT> one thing in common: They were <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">self-deprecating</EVENT>. Sure, some presidents have <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> jokes to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> jabs at their opponents, but not to the extent of Obama.

During his tenure, he has increasingly unleashed biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries. These jokes are <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">intended</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> more than simply entertain you. They have an agenda.

Obama's humor is often <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">delivered</EVENT> the way a comedian dealing with a heckler would do it. He <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION">tries</EVENT> to undermine his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side. I can <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE">assure</EVENT> you that having a crowd laugh at your critic/heckler is not only effective in dominating them, it's also very satisfying.
