<TITLE>New York man admits faking his death</TITLE>

<TEXT>

 A New York man who was <EVENT eid="e1" class="STATE">accused</EVENT> of faking his <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">death</EVENT> last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">announced</EVENT>.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">search</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">involving</EVENT> multiple agencies, New York State Park Police <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, authorities <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">learned</EVENT> the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">pulled</EVENT> over, his wife, Evana, <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE">showed</EVENT> authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE">wanted</EVENT> his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he <EVENT eid="e11" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> a new life in Florida, Rice <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

State police <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">arrested</EVENT> both men in early August on <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">charges</EVENT> of insurance fraud, conspiracy and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">filing</EVENT> a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE">agreed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">plead</EVENT> guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. He also must <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> CNN in August she <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">thought</EVENT> her husband devised the plan after he was <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">fired</EVENT> from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

"There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort," Raymond Roth <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">wrote</EVENT> in an e-mail to his son the day before the son <EVENT eid="e24" class="REPORTING">reported</EVENT> him <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">missing</EVENT>.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, "There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">denied</EVENT> in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

"We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son," Davis <EVENT eid="e28" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> CNN on Thursday. "He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility."

Davis <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">negotiations</EVENT>, Raymond Roth <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_ACTION">asked</EVENT> the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis <EVENT eid="e32" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">arrests</EVENT>, Davis <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

"He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes," he <EVENT eid="e35" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.
