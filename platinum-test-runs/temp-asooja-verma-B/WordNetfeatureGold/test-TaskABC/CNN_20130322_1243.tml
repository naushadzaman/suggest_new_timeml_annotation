<TITLE>Google Keep is a note-taking app with great potential</TITLE>



<TEXT>

Before the <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">arrival</EVENT> of Keep, which Google <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL">launched</EVENT> this week, there was no default <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">note-taking</EVENT> app for Android. It was a glaring hole, <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">considering</EVENT> that Apple's iPhone has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">powered</EVENT> by Siri.

Instead of settling for a bare bones <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">app</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">fill</EVENT> the void, the <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">search</EVENT> giant <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> things one step further. Keep isn't simply just a place to bank whatever random half-thoughts <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to mind: Users can <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">construct</EVENT> to-do lists, stash photos, and color code your notes -- all in one well-designed and easy-to-use interface.

The second you <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">log</EVENT> anything into your phone, it is also accessible from a PC Web browser via Google Drive. Alternatively, you can <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">save</EVENT> things while working on your computer, and it will instantly appear on your phone, ready for use while on the go.

The design may not be as progressive as the to-do app Clear, but Keep makes up for that in its simplicity and efficiency.

Everything in Keep is <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> like a Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) Windows Phone-esque stream of tiles. Swiping left or right will archive those notes you no longer <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">need</EVENT> (but don't <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to erase entirely). At the top of the app is a text entry field that serves as your main point of entry for all new notes. And when <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">viewing</EVENT> any specific note, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">tapping</EVENT> any part of that note (title, body, etc.) will <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_ACTION">allow</EVENT> you to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">edit</EVENT> it. The entire <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">experience</EVENT> is frictionless.

That <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, it's not going to <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">conquer</EVENT> the world quite yet. Organization options are limited -- color coding is your only choice, and you can't <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">re-order</EVENT> your notes. Sharing with others is mostly limited to email and Google+, and the desktop features are pretty bare bones.

But that's more a function of it being new, rather than poorly thought out. Like most things Google, <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_STATE">expect</EVENT> the company to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">flesh</EVENT> out Keep over time and really turn it into our personal internet junk drawer.

It's easy to foresee the day the when users will be <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE">able</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e28" class="I_ACTION">send</EVENT> anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep. The prospect of Keep incorporating features of services such as Pinterest or Pocket, or even <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> it easy to catalog streaming media, could <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it into something big. That should scare Evernote.

Keep is not the reinvention of the wheel in any aspect -- there are a plethora of third-party apps already <EVENT eid="e31" class="STATE">available</EVENT> for Android. But it is a well-exectuted refinement.

In filling a minor, but important gap in its mobile ecosystem, Google <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">gives</EVENT> the competition one less claim of superiority over Android.
