<TITLE>Once Few, Women Hold More Power in Senate</TITLE>

<TEXT>

An hour before her colleagues gathered for their first <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">vote</EVENT> of a new Congress, Senator Kelly Ayotte <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">slipped</EVENT> into an empty Senate chamber to savor the grandeur of her legislative home. As Ms. Ayotte, a freshman Republican from New Hampshire, sat down at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had cast their votes, a doorman marched toward her with purpose.

The desks, he sternly <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> her, were for senators only.

Ms. Ayotte's induction that January day in 2011 into the most rarefied ranks of the nation's political class, female senators, had begun. "The desk thing really <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> with me," Ms. Ayotte <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. "There still just aren't that many of us."

In the 90 years since Rebecca Felton of Georgia <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">became</EVENT> the first woman in the United States Senate - sworn in for a mere 24 hours - women remain an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">morphed</EVENT> from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th century into an important new force on key committees and legislation.

A record nine women now lead committees, including some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">dominated</EVENT> by men. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is charged with shaping the Democratic strategy in the fiscal <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">battle</EVENT> dominating Capitol Hill.

One of the biggest bills to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">pass</EVENT> the Senate last year was <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">farm</EVENT> legislation <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who presides over the agriculture committee. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">shepherded</EVENT> the highway bill.

"We are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in number," <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. "But more importantly, we are <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in our power. When I first started <EVENT eid="e17" class="STATE">just</EVENT> six years ago, it was unusual to have a woman <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION">managing</EVENT> a bill."

Just as important, even male senators <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT>, is the potential the women hold for <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> the tenor of the Senate and <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_ACTION">pushing</EVENT> for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

"I don't <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to generalize, because this isn't true of all of them, but they tend to be interested in finding common ground," <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. "So I <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> it's going to have, and is having, a positive impact on the Senate."

While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">begun</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">crack</EVENT> away at the gridlock by forming coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> the repeal in the Senate of "don't <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">ask</EVENT>, don't tell" in 2010, <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">allowing</EVENT> gay men and women to serve openly in the military.

This year, all four of the female Senate Republicans split with their party and <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">voted</EVENT> with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which had <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">lapsed</EVENT> during the last Congress.
