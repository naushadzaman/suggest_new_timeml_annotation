<TITLE>A New Game for Microsoft's Kinect</TITLE>



<TEXT>

Microsoft Corp. broke sales records in 2010 when it <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">released</EVENT> its Kinect - a movement-tracking device that <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">enabled</EVENT> Xbox users to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> their favorite games through gestures alone, without need of a controller.

Now, with the help of outside developers, the software giant is <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">hoping</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">move</EVENT> the Kinect beyond gaming.

Microsoft is <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">expanding</EVENT> into China with a company-funded incubator program for outside developers to build products based on Kinect technology for a range of industries including health care and retail.

In the U.S., 11 companies were selected last year for the accelerator's first three-month class in Seattle, out of nearly 500 applicants. Microsoft <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> it has <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">identified</EVENT> three companies for the China program to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT> through June.

The company gives each participating startup in the Seattle program $20,000 to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">create</EVENT> software that can be <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> with Kinect for Windows, but it is isn't <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_ACTION">asking</EVENT> for any ownership stakes or intellectual property rights. Microsoft also doesn't <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">have</EVENT> any veto power over the ideas.

What Microsoft <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">gets</EVENT> are developers around the world working on ideas that could potentially <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">open</EVENT> up Kinect for Windows' technology to new markets - and convince consumers and businesses to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">buy</EVENT> the company's hardware and <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> of the potential apps.

The Windows-ready Kinect sensor, which would be necessary for any business that wants to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> these potential new technologies, is currently <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">selling</EVENT> for $250 through Microsoft, more than twice what Microsoft <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_ACTION">charges</EVENT> for the gaming-only Xbox version.
