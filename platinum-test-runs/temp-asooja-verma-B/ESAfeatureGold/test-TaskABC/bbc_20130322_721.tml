<TITLE>Russian police raid rights group Memorial and other NGOs</TITLE>

<TEXT>

Russian police and tax inspectors have <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">raided</EVENT> the offices of the human rights group Memorial and other civil society groups which get foreign funding.

Memorial is famous for <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">documenting</EVENT> human rights abuses in Russia.

The US embassy in Moscow has <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING">voiced</EVENT> concern and <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION">asked</EVENT> the Russian government for an explanation.

A new Russian law <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> foreign-funded non-governmental groups (NGOs) linked to politics must <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">register</EVENT> as "foreign agents" <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">-</EVENT> a term which <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE">suggests</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">spying</EVENT>.

In the worst repressions of the Soviet period the label "foreign agents" was <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">denounce</EVENT> dissidents - or simply political rivals of Joseph Stalin - and could <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_ACTION">lead</EVENT> to execution.

Memorial <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> inspectors <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">returned</EVENT> to its Moscow offices on Friday, having already <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">seized</EVENT> 600 documents including accounts on Thursday.

A statement on the Memorial website <EVENT eid="e16" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the inspections were directly <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">linked</EVENT> to the new law on NGOs and the targeted groups' compliance with it.

Memorial director Arseny Roginsky, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">quoted</EVENT> by the Russian news website Vesti, <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> it was "a complete <EVENT eid="e20" class="STATE">check</EVENT> on everything <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">concerned</EVENT> with our sources of funding".

He <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">insisted</EVENT> that the NGO law "will not <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> our position at all". "We won't <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">refuse</EVENT> foreign donations, nor will we <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">register</EVENT> as a 'foreign agent'," he <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.
