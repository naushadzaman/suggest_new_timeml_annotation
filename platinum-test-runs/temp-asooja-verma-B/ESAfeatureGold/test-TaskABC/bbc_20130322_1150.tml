<TITLE>Last 1953 Everest team member George Lowe dies, aged 89</TITLE>

<TEXT>

The last surviving member of the team which first conquered Everest in 1953 has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT> in a Derbyshire nursing home.

George Lowe, 89, died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness, with his wife Mary by his side.

New Zealand-born Mr Lowe was part of the team that <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_STATE">helped</EVENT> Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">paid</EVENT> tribute to a "gentle soul and fine climber" who <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">shunned</EVENT> the limelight.

Mr Lowe also <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">crossing</EVENT> of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> of his Antarctic adventure: "We <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION">estimated</EVENT> we could do it in 100 days, and we <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">got</EVENT> across on the 99th day.

"There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

"We were <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">pleased</EVENT> that England and New Zealand <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">knew</EVENT> about it, and we thought that's where it would <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">stop</EVENT>."

He also <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">talked</EVENT> about his "second job" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> the clockwork camera.

"When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> part in the urgency - or <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">do</EVENT> you record it?" he <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">met</EVENT> Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a "hero".

"I don't often <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">use</EVENT> that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one," he <EVENT eid="e21" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">published</EVENT> in May.

He <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>: "Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">sought</EVENT> the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_STATE">achievements</EVENT> deserve wider recognition.

"He was <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">involved</EVENT> in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet <EVENT eid="e27" class="STATE">remained</EVENT> a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all."

Before <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">retiring</EVENT> in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">leaves</EVENT> three sons from a previous marriage.

The last British climbing member of the 1953 team, Mike Westmacott, died last June.
