<TITLE>Google Keep is a note-taking app with great potential</TITLE>



<TEXT>

Before the <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">arrival</EVENT> of Keep, which Google <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL">launched</EVENT> this week, there was no default <EVENT eid="e3" class="ASPECTUAL">note-taking</EVENT> app for Android. It was a glaring hole, <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">considering</EVENT> that Apple's iPhone has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">powered</EVENT> by Siri.

Instead of settling for a bare bones <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">app</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">fill</EVENT> the void, the <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">search</EVENT> giant <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">took</EVENT> things one step further. Keep isn't simply just a place to bank whatever random half-thoughts <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to mind: Users can <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">construct</EVENT> to-do lists, stash photos, and color code your notes -- all in one well-designed and easy-to-use interface.

The second you <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">log</EVENT> anything into your phone, it is also accessible from a PC Web browser via Google Drive. Alternatively, you can <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">save</EVENT> things while working on your computer, and it will instantly <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">appear</EVENT> on your phone, ready for use while on the go.

The design may not be as progressive as the to-do app Clear, but Keep <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">makes</EVENT> up for that in its simplicity and efficiency.

Everything in Keep is <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> like a Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) Windows Phone-esque stream of tiles. Swiping left or right will archive those notes you no longer <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">need</EVENT> (but don't <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to erase entirely). At the <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">top</EVENT> of the app is a text entry field that serves as your main point of entry for all new notes. And when <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">viewing</EVENT> any specific note, <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">tapping</EVENT> any part of that note (<EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">title</EVENT>, body, etc.) will <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">allow</EVENT> you to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">edit</EVENT> it. The entire <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">experience</EVENT> is frictionless.

That <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, it's not going to <EVENT eid="e27" class="ASPECTUAL">conquer</EVENT> the world quite yet. Organization options are <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">limited</EVENT> -- color <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">coding</EVENT> is your only choice, and you can't <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">re-order</EVENT> your notes. Sharing with others is mostly limited to email and Google+, and the desktop features are pretty bare <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">bones</EVENT>.

But that's more a function of it being new, rather than poorly <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">thought</EVENT> out. Like most things Google, <EVENT eid="e33" class="I_STATE">expect</EVENT> the company to <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">flesh</EVENT> out Keep over time and really <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it into our personal internet junk drawer.

It's easy to foresee the day the when users will be able to <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_ACTION">send</EVENT> anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep. The prospect of Keep incorporating features of services such as Pinterest or Pocket, or even <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_ACTION">making</EVENT> it easy to catalog streaming media, could <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it into something big. That should scare Evernote.

Keep is not the reinvention of the wheel in any aspect -- there are a plethora of third-party apps already <EVENT eid="e39" class="STATE">available</EVENT> for Android. But it is a well-exectuted refinement.

In <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">filling</EVENT> a minor, but important gap in its mobile ecosystem, Google <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">gives</EVENT> the competition one less <EVENT eid="e42" class="REPORTING">claim</EVENT> of superiority over Android.
