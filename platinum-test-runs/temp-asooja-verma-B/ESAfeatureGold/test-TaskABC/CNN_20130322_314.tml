<TITLE>Obama gets diplomatic coup before heading to refugee-flooded Jordan</TITLE>



<TEXT>

President Barack Obama <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">arrived</EVENT> in refugee-flooded Jordan on Friday after <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">scoring</EVENT> a diplomatic <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">coup</EVENT> just before <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">leaving</EVENT> Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">raid</EVENT> that <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla.

The apology, long <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">sought</EVENT> by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE">eased</EVENT> strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East.

It <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT> in a phone <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">call</EVENT> to Erdogan during a final <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">meeting</EVENT> between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv minutes before Air Force One <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">departed</EVENT> for Jordan to <EVENT eid="e13" class="ASPECTUAL">complete</EVENT> the president's Middle East swing. It is the first foreign trip of his second term.

A statement from Netanyahu's office <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the apology included an <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">offer</EVENT> of compensation. However, there was confusion later when the Israeli government <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">dropped</EVENT> a reference in its original <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">statement</EVENT> to normalized relations between the countries with a <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">return</EVENT> of ambassadors.

There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would <EVENT eid="e19" class="ASPECTUAL">resume</EVENT> the joint military <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">exercises</EVENT> that were <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">suspended</EVENT> after the flotilla raid.

Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the two leaders <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement <EVENT eid="e24" class="REPORTING">omitted</EVENT> that action as well.
