<TITLE>As Pollution Worsens in China, Solutions Succumb to Infighting</TITLE>

<TEXT>

China's state leadership <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">transition</EVENT> has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> place this month against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 dead pigs have been <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">floating</EVENT> in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">cloaked</EVENT> the capital, <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">causing</EVENT> convulsive coughing and <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">obscuring</EVENT> the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">forced</EVENT> to openly <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">acknowledge</EVENT> them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">checked</EVENT> for smog every morning after <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">opening</EVENT> her curtains and <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him "quite upset" and <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">vowed</EVENT> to "<EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> even greater <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">resolve</EVENT> and make more vigorous efforts" to clean it up.

Last month, after deadly air pollution <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> record levels in northern China, officials <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">resisted</EVENT> a similar government <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION">order</EVENT> for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_ACTION">orders</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">upgrade</EVENT> coal-burning electricity plants, <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies <EVENT eid="e24" class="STATE">exert</EVENT> an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">discussions</EVENT> over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">proposals</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that the costs of <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">upgrading</EVENT> the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that China's current economic <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">policies</EVENT> would <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">result</EVENT> in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. "China's air pollution will <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> a lot worse from the already unbearable level," the analysts <EVENT eid="e33" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>, calling for drastic policy <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">changes</EVENT> and "a strong government will to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">overcome</EVENT> the opposition from interest groups."

The report <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_ACTION">estimated</EVENT> that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> 400 million by 2030, up from 90 million now.
