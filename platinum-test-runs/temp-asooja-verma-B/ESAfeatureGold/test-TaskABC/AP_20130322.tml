<TITLE>105 U.S. Kids Died From Flu, CDC Says</TITLE>



<TEXT>

The flu season is <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">winding</EVENT> down, and it has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> 105 children so far - about the average toll.

The season <EVENT eid="e3" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="STATE">about</EVENT> a month earlier than usual, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">sparking</EVENT> concerns it might <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> into the worst in a decade. It <EVENT eid="e7" class="ASPECTUAL">ended</EVENT> up being very hard on the elderly, but was moderately severe overall, <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six of the pediatric <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">deaths</EVENT> were <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING">reported</EVENT> in the last week, and it's possible there will be more, <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Friday.

Roughly 100 children <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">die</EVENT> in an average flu season. One exception was the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, when 348 children died.

The CDC recommends that all children ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu each season, though only about half get a flu shot or nasal spray.

All but four of the children who died were old enough to be <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">vaccinated</EVENT>, but 90 percent of them did not get vaccinated, CDC officials <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

This year's vaccine was <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE">considered</EVENT> effective in children, though it didn't work very well in older people. And the dominant flu strain early in the season was one that <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE">tends</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">cause</EVENT> more severe illness.

The government only does a national flu death count for children. But it does <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">track</EVENT> hospitalization rates for people 65 and older, and those statistics have been grim.

In that group, 177 out of every 100,000 were <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">hospitalized</EVENT> with flu-related illness in the past several months. That's more than 2 1/2 times higher than any other recent season.

This flu season <EVENT eid="e21" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> in early December, a month earlier than usual, and <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">peaked</EVENT> by the end of year. Since then, flu reports have been <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">dropping</EVENT> off throughout the country.

"We <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_STATE">appear</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e26" class="ASPECTUAL">close</EVENT> to the end of flu season," Jhung <EVENT eid="e27" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.
