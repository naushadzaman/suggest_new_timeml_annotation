<TITLE>The Terminal Cancer Patient Who Won a Marathon</TITLE>


<TEXT>

In competitions against the clock, some athletes <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">display</EVENT> an <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_STATE">ability</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">seize</EVENT> control. Think of the Clark-Kent-to-Superman routines that John Elway and Michael Jordan often pulled in the final seconds.

But Iram Leon stands on the sidelines of his own race against time. Lodged in his brain is an untreatable and inoperable cancerous tumor that statistics <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE">suggest</EVENT> will <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">kill</EVENT> him before he is 40, eight years from now. Medical science is <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">advancing</EVENT> at a rate that doesn't <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">preclude</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">development</EVENT> of a treatment, but it's not clear if it will <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> in time.

"No one knows what technology will be <EVENT eid="e10" class="STATE">available</EVENT> in five years," <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Allan Friedman, Duke University Hospital neurosurgeon in chief, who in 2011 removed as much of Leon's brain tumor as possible.

The torment of enduring that wait can paste a cancer patient to the couch, a <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">surrender</EVENT> heavily associated with deadlier outcomes. Some seek escape in their careers, but that is no longer an option for Leon, who early this year was <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_STATE">forced</EVENT> to step down as a juvenile probation officer in Travis County, Texas, a position he <EVENT eid="e14" class="STATE">had</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e15" class="STATE">held</EVENT> for almost seven years. His thinking is no longer clear, said Leon, <EVENT eid="e16" class="REPORTING">adding</EVENT>, "I was <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">making</EVENT> too many mistakes on the stand."

But Leon can still <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">run</EVENT>. Two years after his brain-cancer diagnosis, he recently <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE">ran</EVENT> a sub-five-minute mile for the first time since high school. What has <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION">startled</EVENT> the medical community even more is what Leon did this month in Beaumont, Texas. He <EVENT eid="e21" class="ASPECTUAL">won</EVENT> the Gusher Marathon, finishing in 3:07:35. That was one second slower than his personal record in the 26.2-mile event, set days before he <EVENT eid="e22" class="ASPECTUAL">underwent</EVENT> brain surgery in early 2011.
