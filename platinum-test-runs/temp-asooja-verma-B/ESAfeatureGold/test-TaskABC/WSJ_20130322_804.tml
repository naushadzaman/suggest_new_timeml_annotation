<TITLE>Health Insurers Warn on Premiums</TITLE>



<TEXT>

Health insurers are privately <EVENT eid="e1" class="I_ACTION">warning</EVENT> brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul law, with the nation's biggest firm <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">projecting</EVENT> that rates could more than <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">double</EVENT> for some consumers buying their own plans.

The projections, made in sessions with brokers and agents, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">provide</EVENT> some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> prices when major provisions of the law kick in next year - a subject of rigorous debate.

The projected <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">increases</EVENT> are at odds with what the Obama Administration <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> consumers should be expecting overall in terms of cost. The Department of Health and Human Services <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> that the law will "<EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> health-care coverage more affordable and accessible," <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION">pointing</EVENT> to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower.

The gulf between the <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">pricing</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">talk</EVENT> from some insurers and the government projections <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_ACTION">suggests</EVENT> how complicated the law's effects will be. Carriers will be <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">filing</EVENT> proposed prices with regulators over the next few months.

Part of the murkiness <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">stems</EVENT> from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION">help</EVENT> lower-income consumers <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">defray</EVENT> costs, but they are generally not included in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The effects of the law will vary widely, and insurers and other analysts <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_STATE">agree</EVENT> that some consumers and small businesses will likely <EVENT eid="e22" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> premiums <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> down.

Starting next year, the law will block insurers from <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">refusing</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> coverage or <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">setting</EVENT> premiums based on people's health histories, and will <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> their ability to <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> rates based on age. That can <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">raise</EVENT> coverage prices for younger, healthier consumers, while reining them in for older, sicker ones. The rules can also affect small businesses, which sometimes <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> premiums tied to employees' health status and claims history.
