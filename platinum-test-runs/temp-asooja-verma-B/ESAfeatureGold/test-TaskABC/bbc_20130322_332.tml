<TITLE>BP to buy back $8bn in shares after Russian sale</TITLE>

<TEXT>

Oil giant BP has <EVENT eid="e1" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> it will <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">buy</EVENT> back $8bn of shares, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">returning</EVENT> to shareholders the money they had <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> into a complicated Russian venture.

It <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> it "<EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE">expected</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">return</EVENT> to BP shareholders an amount equivalent to the value of the company's original <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">investment</EVENT> in TNK-BP".

BP <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> back its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Russia's Rosneft in October in <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">return</EVENT> for $17.1bn in cash and shares.

It invested in TNK-BP in 2003.

BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg <EVENT eid="e12" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>: "We <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_STATE">expect</EVENT> our stake in Rosneft will <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">generate</EVENT> long-term value for BP and its shareholders. But this buyback programme should also <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_ACTION">allow</EVENT> our shareholders to <EVENT eid="e16" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> benefits in the near-term from the value we have <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">realised</EVENT> by <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION">reshaping</EVENT> our Russian business."

BP <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE">expects</EVENT> the share buyback programme could <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> between 12 and 18 months to <EVENT eid="e21" class="ASPECTUAL">complete</EVENT>.

"In 2003 BP invested around $8bn in cash, shares and assets in the formation of TNK-BP," the oil giant <EVENT eid="e22" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>. "Over the <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">following</EVENT> decade BP <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">received</EVENT> a total of $19bn in dividends from the joint venture."

Although BP's involvement in the Russian joint venture has been lucrative, relations with its partners have often been <EVENT eid="e25" class="STATE">fraught</EVENT> with disagreement. In 2011, the AAR consortium <EVENT eid="e26" class="I_ACTION">attempted</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_ACTION">block</EVENT> a drilling joint venture in the Arctic between BP and Rosneft through the courts and the plan was eventually <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">dropped</EVENT>.

As well as internal wrangles, BP employees at TNK-BP have <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">fallen</EVENT> foul of Russian authorities.

While <EVENT eid="e30" class="I_ACTION">serving</EVENT> as head of TNK-BP, Bob Dudley - now the head of BP as a whole - had his office bugged and <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">raided</EVENT> by the police and met with onerous back-tax demands, legal action and visa problems.

He eventually <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">fled</EVENT> the country in 2008.

But the tie-up with Rosneft will <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> BP in Russia, <EVENT eid="e34" class="I_ACTION">allowing</EVENT> it to <EVENT eid="e35" class="ASPECTUAL">continue</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">explore</EVENT> and exploit the country's vast energy resources, including in the Arctic region. And Rosneft benefits from BP's expertise in <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">exploring</EVENT> in difficult and potentially hazardous conditions.
