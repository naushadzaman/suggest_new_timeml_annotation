Former President Nicolas Sarkozy was <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">informed</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013-03-21">Thursday</TIMEX3> that he would <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">face</EVENT> a formal investigation into whether he <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">abused</EVENT> the frailty of Liliane Bettencourt, 90, the heiress to the L'Oreal fortune and France's richest woman, to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">funds</EVENT> for his <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> presidential campaign. Mr. Sarkozy has <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">denied</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">accepting</EVENT> illegal campaign funds from Ms. Bettencourt, either personally or through his party treasurer at the time, Eric Woerth, as alleged by her former butler. Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION">called</EVENT> the judge's decision, which indicates that the judge believes that Mr. Sarkozy probably <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">committed</EVENT> a crime, "incoherent" and "unjust." The lawyer <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> he would <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">appeal</EVENT>. The ruling does not necessarily <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">mean</EVENT> that Mr. Sarkozy, who <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> his re-election <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">bid</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">last</EVENT> May and with it his presidential immunity from prosecution, will <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">stand</EVENT> trial.
