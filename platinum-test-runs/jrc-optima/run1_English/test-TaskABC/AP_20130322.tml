The flu <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3> is winding down, and it has <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> 105 children so far - about the average toll.

The <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2013-02">about a month earlier</TIMEX3> than usual, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">sparking</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">concerns</EVENT> it might <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> into the worst in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3>. It <EVENT eid="e6" class="ASPECTUAL">ended</EVENT> up being very hard on the elderly, but was moderately severe overall, <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">according</EVENT> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six of the pediatric <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">deaths</EVENT> were <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING">reported</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1W">in the last week</TIMEX3>, and it's possible there will be more, <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> the CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">Friday</TIMEX3>.

Roughly 100 children <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">die</EVENT> in an average flu <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3>. One exception was the swine flu pandemic of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, when 348 children <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT>.

The CDC <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">recommends</EVENT> that all children <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">ages</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> and older be vaccinated against flu <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">each season</TIMEX3>, though only about half get a flu <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">shot</EVENT> or nasal spray.

All but four of the children <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">who died</EVENT> were old enough to be <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">vaccinated</EVENT>, but 90 percent of them <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT> not <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">vaccinated</EVENT>, CDC officials <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2013">This year</TIMEX3>'s vaccine was <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">considered</EVENT> effective in children, though it didn't <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">work</EVENT> very well in older people. And the dominant flu <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">strain</EVENT> early in the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3> was one that tends to <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">cause</EVENT> more severe illness.

The government only does a national flu <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">death</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">count</EVENT> for children. But it does <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">track</EVENT> hospitalization <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">rates</EVENT> for people 65 and older, and those statistics have been grim.

In that group, 177 out of every 100,000 were <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">hospitalized</EVENT> with flu-related illness <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXM">in the past several months</TIMEX3>. That's more than 2 1/2 <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">times</EVENT> higher than any other recent <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3>.

This flu <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e38" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-12">in early December</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2013-02">a month earlier</TIMEX3> than usual, and peaked by the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">year</TIMEX3>. Since then, flu reports have been <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">dropping</EVENT> off throughout the country.

"We <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">appear</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">close</EVENT> to the end of flu <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1M">season</TIMEX3>," Jhung <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>.
