<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2013-03-20T23:00">An hour before</TIMEX3> her colleagues <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> for their first vote of a new Congress, Senator Kelly Ayotte <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">slipped</EVENT> into an empty Senate chamber to <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">savor</EVENT> the grandeur of her legislative home. As Ms. Ayotte, a freshman Republican from New Hampshire, <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">sat</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">down</EVENT> at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">cast</EVENT> their votes, a doorman <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">marched</EVENT> toward her with purpose.

The desks, he sternly <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">told</EVENT> her, were for senators only.

Ms. Ayotte's induction <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013-01">that January</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">day</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> into the most rarefied ranks of the nation's political class, female senators, had <EVENT eid="e9" class="ASPECTUAL">begun</EVENT>. "The desk thing really <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> with me," Ms. Ayotte <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>. "There still just aren't that many of us."

In the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P90Y">90 years</TIMEX3> since Rebecca Felton of Georgia <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> the first woman in the United States Senate - <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">sworn</EVENT> in for a mere <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> - women <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">remain</EVENT> an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have morphed from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1CE">century</TIMEX3> into an important new force on key committees and legislation.

A <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">record</EVENT> nine women now <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">lead</EVENT> committees, <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">including</EVENT> some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">dominated</EVENT> by men. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">charged</EVENT> with <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">shaping</EVENT> the Democratic strategy in the fiscal battle dominating Capitol Hill.

One of the biggest bills to <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">pass</EVENT> the Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012">last year</TIMEX3> was farm legislation <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">presides</EVENT> over the agriculture committee. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">shepherded</EVENT> the highway <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">bill</EVENT>.

"We are <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in number," <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. "But more importantly, we are <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in our power. When I first started just <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2007">six years ago</TIMEX3>, it was unusual to <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">have</EVENT> a woman <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">managing</EVENT> a bill."

Just as important, <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">even</EVENT> male senators <EVENT eid="e33" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT>, is the potential the women <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">hold</EVENT> for <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> the tenor of the Senate and <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_ACTION">pushing</EVENT> for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

"I don't <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">generalize</EVENT>, because this isn't true of all of them, but they <EVENT eid="e39" class="I_STATE">tend</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">interested</EVENT> in <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">finding</EVENT> common ground," <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. "So I <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> it's <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">have</EVENT>, and is having, a positive impact on the Senate."

While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have <EVENT eid="e46" class="ASPECTUAL">begun</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">crack</EVENT> away at the gridlock by <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">forming</EVENT> coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> the repeal in the Senate of "don't <EVENT eid="e50" class="I_ACTION">ask</EVENT>, don't <EVENT eid="e51" class="REPORTING">tell</EVENT>" in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">allowing</EVENT> gay men and women to <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">serve</EVENT> openly in the military.

<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2013">This year</TIMEX3>, all four of the female Senate Republicans <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">split</EVENT> with their party and <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">voted</EVENT> with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed during the last Congress.
