In competitions against the clock, some athletes <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">display</EVENT> an ability to <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">seize</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">control</EVENT>. Think of the Clark-Kent-to-Superman routines that John Elway and Michael Jordan often <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">pulled</EVENT> in the final seconds.

But Iram Leon <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">stands</EVENT> on the sidelines of his own race against time. Lodged in his brain is an untreatable and inoperable cancerous tumor that statistics <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION">suggest</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">will kill</EVENT> him before he is 40, <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> from now. Medical science is <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">advancing</EVENT> at a rate that doesn't preclude the development of a treatment, but it's not <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">clear</EVENT> if it will <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> in time.

"No one <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE">knows</EVENT> what technology will be available in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3>," <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Allan Friedman, Duke University Hospital neurosurgeon in chief, who in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">removed</EVENT> as much of Leon's brain tumor as possible.

The <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">torment</EVENT> of <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">enduring</EVENT> that wait can <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">paste</EVENT> a cancer patient to the couch, a surrender heavily <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">associated</EVENT> with deadlier outcomes. Some <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_ACTION">seek</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">escape</EVENT> in their careers, but that is no longer an option for Leon, who early <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013">this year</TIMEX3> was <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">forced</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">step</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">down</EVENT> as a juvenile probation officer in Travis County, Texas, a position he had <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">almost seven years</TIMEX3>. His thinking is no longer clear, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Leon, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">adding</EVENT>, "I was <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> too many mistakes on the stand."

But Leon <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> still run. <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">Two years after</TIMEX3> his brain-cancer diagnosis, he recently <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">ran</EVENT> a sub-five-minute mile for the first time since high school. What has <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">startled</EVENT> the medical community <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">even</EVENT> more is what Leon <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013-03">this month</TIMEX3> in Beaumont, Texas. He <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">won</EVENT> the Gusher Marathon, <EVENT eid="e35" class="ASPECTUAL">finishing</EVENT> in 3:07:35. That was one <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">second</EVENT> slower than his personal record in the 26.2-mile event, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">set days before</TIMEX3> he <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">underwent</EVENT> brain surgery in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011">early 2011</TIMEX3>.
