A Cyprus <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">exit</EVENT> from the euro union, if it <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">comes</EVENT> to that, would have a devastating effect on the country's citizens, who are among the most indebted in the euro zone. And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster.

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">resulting</EVENT> from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">return</EVENT> to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">created</EVENT> had it not been <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">bailed</EVENT> out.

And that, economists and investors <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">contend</EVENT>, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">ministers</EVENT>, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">contribute</EVENT> 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.

Greece <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">may</EVENT> well have been too big to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">fail</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">last year</TIMEX3>, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.

From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">times</EVENT> the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">recover</EVENT> from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries.

As debts in Europe <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">mount</EVENT> in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> good on them, the view is <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">forming</EVENT> in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">sent</EVENT> that citizens and investors must <EVENT eid="e18" class="ASPECTUAL">start</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">accepting</EVENT> losses for the euro zone to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">survive</EVENT> in the long run.

"There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">time</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">remove</EVENT> the air bags," <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">runs</EVENT> a hedge fund in London. "This is not a Lehman," he <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">referring</EVENT> to the disastrous chain reaction <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">touched</EVENT> off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3>.

Eric Dor is a French economist who has <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">studied</EVENT> the mechanics of how a country might <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">remove</EVENT> itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">compared</EVENT> with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_ACTION">forced</EVENT> into a disorderly euro exit have <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">ranged</EVENT> from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">given</EVENT> the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.

"This <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING">explains</EVENT> why Germany and others are <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">putting</EVENT> so much pressure on Cyprus," <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> Mr. Dor, <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">head</EVENT> of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. "They are <EVENT eid="e39" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> we <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> the risk of <EVENT eid="e42" class="I_ACTION">pushing</EVENT> Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">take</EVENT> the losses without going broke."

Mr. Dor <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">notes</EVENT> that the current euro zonewide system of <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">insuring</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">bank</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">deposits</EVENT> up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">collapse</EVENT>. Those deposits are <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">supposed</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">insured</EVENT> by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus <EVENT eid="e52" class="REPORTING">admitted</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2013-W12">this week</TIMEX3> that his country <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">did</EVENT> not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">guaranteed</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">bank</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">deposits</EVENT> - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">snapped</EVENT>.

"It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has <EVENT eid="e59" class="REPORTING">admitted</EVENT> that he could not <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">afford</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> the guarantee," Mr. Dor <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>.

A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent, once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus <EVENT eid="e65" class="OCCURRENCE">used</EVENT> before <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">adopting</EVENT> the euro in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3>.
