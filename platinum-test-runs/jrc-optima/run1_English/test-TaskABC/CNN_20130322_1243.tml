Before the arrival of Keep, which Google <EVENT eid="e0" class="ASPECTUAL">launched</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013-W12">this week</TIMEX3>, there was no default note-taking app for Android. It was a glaring hole, <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">considering</EVENT> that Apple's iPhone has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">powered</EVENT> by Siri.

Instead of <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">settling</EVENT> for a bare bones app to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">fill</EVENT> the void, the search giant took things one <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">step</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">further</EVENT>. Keep <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">isn't</EVENT> simply just a place to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">bank</EVENT> whatever random half-thoughts <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">mind</EVENT>: Users <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">construct</EVENT> to-do <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">lists</EVENT>, stash photos, and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">color</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">code</EVENT> your notes -- all in one well-designed and easy-to-use <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">interface</EVENT>.

The <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">second</EVENT> you <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">log</EVENT> anything into your phone, it is also accessible from a PC Web browser via Google Drive. Alternatively, you <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">save</EVENT> things while <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">working</EVENT> on your computer, and it <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">will</EVENT> instantly <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">appear</EVENT> on your phone, ready for use while on the go.

The <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">design</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">may</EVENT> not be as progressive as the to-do app Clear, but Keep <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">makes</EVENT> up for that in its simplicity and efficiency.

Everything in Keep is <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">presented</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_STATE">like</EVENT> a Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) Windows Phone-esque <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">stream</EVENT> of tiles. Swiping <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">left</EVENT> or right will archive those notes you no longer need (but don't <EVENT eid="e32" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">erase</EVENT> entirely). At the top of the app is a text entry field that serves as your main point of entry for all new notes. And when <EVENT eid="e34" class="PERCEPTION">viewing</EVENT> any specific note, <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">tapping</EVENT> any part of that note (title, body, etc.) will <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">allow</EVENT> you to <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">edit</EVENT> it. The entire experience is frictionless.

That <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>, it's not <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">conquer</EVENT> the world quite yet. Organization options are <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">limited</EVENT> -- <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">color</EVENT> coding is your only choice, and you can't re-order your notes. Sharing with others is mostly <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">limited</EVENT> to email and Google+, and the desktop features are pretty bare bones.

But that's more a function of it being new, rather than poorly thought out. Like most things Google, <EVENT eid="e44" class="I_ACTION">expect</EVENT> the company to flesh out Keep over time and really <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it into our personal internet <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">junk</EVENT> drawer.

It's easy to <EVENT eid="e48" class="I_STATE">foresee</EVENT> the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">day</TIMEX3> the when users will be able to <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">send</EVENT> anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep. The <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">prospect</EVENT> of Keep <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">incorporating</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">features</EVENT> of services such as Pinterest or Pocket, or even making it easy to <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">catalog</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">streaming</EVENT> media, could <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> it into something big. That should <EVENT eid="e56" class="I_STATE">scare</EVENT> Evernote.

Keep is not the reinvention of the wheel in any aspect -- there are a plethora of third-party apps already available for Android. But it is a well-exectuted refinement.

In <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">filling</EVENT> a minor, but important gap in its mobile ecosystem, Google <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">gives</EVENT> the competition one less claim of superiority over Android.
