The <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION">call</EVENT>, which happened as President Barack Obama <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">wrapped</EVENT> up his first presidential visit to Israel, was an unexpected outcome from a Mideast <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">trip</EVENT> that seemed to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">yield</EVENT> few concrete steps.

Mr. Netanyahu's office <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">confirmed</EVENT> that the Israeli leader, in a conversation with Mr. Erdogan, "<EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e10" class="ASPECTUAL">restore</EVENT> normalization between Israel and Turkey, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">including</EVENT> the dispatch of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal steps against [Israeli Defense Forces] soldiers."

An Israeli raid on the ship left nine passengers <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">dead</EVENT>, all of them Turkish or of Turkish descent.

"In <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">light</EVENT> of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Prime Minister Netanyahu <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">apologized</EVENT> to the Turkish people for any errors that could have <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> to loss of life and <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e21" class="ASPECTUAL">complete</EVENT> the agreement on compensation," the statement <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>.

Mr. Netanyahu <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">told</EVENT> Mr. Erdogan that what happened on board the Mavi Marmara was "unintentional and Israel <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">expresses</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">regret</EVENT> over injuries and loss of life," <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">according</EVENT> to the statement.

Mr. Obama <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> later at a news conference in Amman that he had <EVENT eid="e28" class="REPORTING">spoken</EVENT> to both leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">over the past two years</TIMEX3> about how it was in the interests of both countries to <EVENT eid="e29" class="ASPECTUAL">restore</EVENT> normal relations.
