Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could <EVENT eid="e0" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> sharply <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2014">next year</TIMEX3> because of the health-care <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">overhaul</EVENT> law, with the nation's biggest firm projecting that rates could more than <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">double</EVENT> for some consumers <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">buying</EVENT> their own plans.

The projections, <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> in sessions with brokers and agents, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">provide</EVENT> some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">prices</EVENT> when major provisions of the law <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">kick</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">in next year</TIMEX3> - a subject of rigorous debate.

The <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">projected</EVENT> increases are at odds with what the Obama Administration <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> consumers should be <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION">expecting</EVENT> overall in terms of <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">cost</EVENT>. The Department of Health and Human Services <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> that the law <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">will</EVENT> "<EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> health-care coverage more affordable and accessible," <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">pointing</EVENT> to a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">lower</EVENT>.

The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_ACTION">suggests</EVENT> how <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">complicated</EVENT> the law's <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">effects</EVENT> will be. Carriers will be <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">filing</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">proposed</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">prices</EVENT> with regulators <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXM">over the next few months</TIMEX3>.

Part of the murkiness <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">stems</EVENT> from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">help</EVENT> lower-income consumers <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">defray</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE">costs</EVENT>, but they are generally not <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">included</EVENT> in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">effects</EVENT> of the law will <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">vary</EVENT> widely, and insurers and other analysts <EVENT eid="e34" class="I_ACTION">agree</EVENT> that some consumers and small businesses <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">will</EVENT> likely see premiums <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">down</EVENT>.

Starting <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">next year</TIMEX3>, the law will <EVENT eid="e38" class="ASPECTUAL">block</EVENT> insurers from <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">refusing</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> coverage or <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">setting</EVENT> premiums <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">based</EVENT> on people's health histories, and will <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> their ability to <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">rates</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">based</EVENT> on age. That <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">raise</EVENT> coverage <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">prices</EVENT> for younger, healthier consumers, while reining them in for older, sicker ones. The <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">rules</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">can</EVENT> also <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">affect</EVENT> small businesses, which sometimes <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> premiums <EVENT eid="e54" class="OCCURRENCE">tied</EVENT> to employees' health status and <EVENT eid="e55" class="REPORTING">claims</EVENT> history.
