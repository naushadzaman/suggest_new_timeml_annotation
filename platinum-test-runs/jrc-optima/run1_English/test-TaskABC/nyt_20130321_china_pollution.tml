China's <EVENT eid="e0" class="REPORTING">state</EVENT> leadership transition has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">taken</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">place</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013-03">this month</TIMEX3> against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">dead</EVENT> pigs have been <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">floating</EVENT> in rivers that provide drinking <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE">water</EVENT> to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">causing</EVENT> convulsive coughing and <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">obscuring</EVENT> the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_ACTION">forced</EVENT> to openly <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING">acknowledge</EVENT> them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> she <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">checked</EVENT> for smog every morning after opening her curtains and <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">kept</EVENT> at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> the air pollution had <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> him "quite <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">upset</EVENT>" and <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">vowed</EVENT> to "<EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">show</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">even</EVENT> greater resolve and <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> more vigorous efforts" to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE">clean</EVENT> it up.

<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2013-02">Last month</TIMEX3>, after deadly air pollution <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> record levels in northern China, officials <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">forward</EVENT> strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had <EVENT eid="e31" class="ASPECTUAL">blocked</EVENT> for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PY">years</TIMEX3>. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">comply</EVENT>, especially since oil officials <EVENT eid="e33" class="ASPECTUAL">resisted</EVENT> a similar government <EVENT eid="e34" class="I_ACTION">order</EVENT> for higher-grade fuel <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009">four years ago</TIMEX3>. State-owned <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE">power</EVENT> companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">ignore</EVENT> government <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_ACTION">orders</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">upgrade</EVENT> coal-burning electricity <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">plants</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE">according</EVENT> to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">exert</EVENT> an outsize influence over environmental policy <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">debates</EVENT>.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_ACTION">pushed</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">back</EVENT> hard against the proposals, <EVENT eid="e45" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that the costs of <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">upgrading</EVENT> the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE">released an</EVENT> analysts' <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">note</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e49" class="REPORTING">saying</EVENT> that China's current economic policies would <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">result</EVENT> in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">over the next decade</TIMEX3>. "China's <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE">air</EVENT> pollution will <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> a lot worse from the already unbearable level," the analysts <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e54" class="I_ACTION">calling</EVENT> for drastic policy <EVENT eid="e56" class="OCCURRENCE">changes</EVENT> and "a strong government <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">will</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e58" class="OCCURRENCE">overcome</EVENT> the opposition from interest <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">groups</EVENT>."

The <EVENT eid="e60" class="REPORTING">report</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">estimated</EVENT> that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to <EVENT eid="e62" class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> 400 million by <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2030">2030</TIMEX3>, up from 90 million now.
