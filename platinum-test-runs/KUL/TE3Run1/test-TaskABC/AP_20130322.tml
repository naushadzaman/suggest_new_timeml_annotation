<TITLE>105 U.S. Kids Died From Flu, CDC Says</TITLE>



<TEXT>

The flu season is <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">winding</EVENT> down, and it has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> 105 children so far - about the average toll.

The season <EVENT eid="e3" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> about <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> earlier than usual, sparking concerns it might <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">turn</EVENT> into the worst in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1E">a decade.</TIMEX3> It <EVENT eid="e5" class="ASPECTUAL">ended</EVENT> up being very hard on the elderly, but was moderately severe overall, <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six of the pediatric deaths were <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING">reported</EVENT> in the last week, and it's possible there will be more, <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">Friday</TIMEX3>.

Roughly 100 children <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">die</EVENT> in an average flu season. One exception was the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, when 348 children <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT>.

The CDC <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_ACTION">recommends</EVENT> that all children ages <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> and older be <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">vaccinated</EVENT> against flu each season, though only about half <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> a flu <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">shot</EVENT> or nasal spray.

All but four of the children who <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">died</EVENT> were old enough to be <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">vaccinated</EVENT>, but 90 percent of them did not <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">get vaccinated</EVENT>, CDC officials <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2013">This year</TIMEX3>'s vaccine was <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_STATE">considered</EVENT> effective in children, though it didn't work very well in older people. And the dominant flu strain early in the season was one that tends to <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE">cause</EVENT> more severe illness.

The government only does a national flu death count for children. But it does <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">track</EVENT> hospitalization rates for people 65 and older, and those statistics have been grim.

In that group, 177 out of every 100,000 were <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">hospitalized</EVENT> with flu-related illness in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the past several months.</TIMEX3> That's more than 2 1/2 times higher than any other recent season.

This flu season <EVENT eid="e24" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013-12">early December</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> earlier than usual, and <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE">peaked</EVENT> by the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2013">year.</TIMEX3> Since then, flu reports have been <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE">dropping</EVENT> off throughout the country.

"We <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE">appear</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> close to the end of flu season," Jhung <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>.
