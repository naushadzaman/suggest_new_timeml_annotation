<TITLE>Once Few, Women Hold More Power in Senate</TITLE>

<TEXT>

<TIMEX3 tid="t79" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">An hour</TIMEX3> before her colleagues <EVENT eid="e491" class="OCCURRENCE">gathered</EVENT> for their first <EVENT eid="e492" class="OCCURRENCE">vote</EVENT> of a new Congress, Senator Kelly Ayotte <EVENT eid="e493" class="OCCURRENCE">slipped</EVENT> into an empty Senate chamber to <EVENT eid="e494" class="OCCURRENCE">savor</EVENT> the grandeur of her legislative home. As Ms. Ayotte, a freshman Republican from New Hampshire, <EVENT eid="e495" class="OCCURRENCE">sat</EVENT> down at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had <EVENT eid="e496" class="OCCURRENCE">cast</EVENT> their votes, a doorman <EVENT eid="e497" class="OCCURRENCE">marched</EVENT> toward her with purpose.

The desks, he sternly <EVENT eid="e498" class="REPORTING">told</EVENT> her, were for senators only.

Ms. Ayotte's induction that <TIMEX3 tid="t80" type="DATE" value="2013-04-21">January day</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> into the most rarefied ranks of the nation's political class, female senators, had <EVENT eid="e499" class="ASPECTUAL">begun.</EVENT> "The desk thing really <EVENT eid="e500" class="OCCURRENCE">stuck</EVENT> with me," Ms. Ayotte <EVENT eid="e501" class="REPORTING">said.</EVENT> "There still just aren't that many of us."

In <TIMEX3 tid="t82" type="DURATION" value="P90Y">the 90 years</TIMEX3> since Rebecca Felton of Georgia <EVENT eid="e502" class="STATE">became</EVENT> the first woman in the United States Senate - <EVENT eid="e503" class="REPORTING">sworn</EVENT> in for <TIMEX3 tid="t83" type="TIME" value="2013-03-21T00:00">a mere 24 hours</TIMEX3> - women <EVENT eid="e504" class="STATE">remain</EVENT> an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have <EVENT eid="e505" class="OCCURRENCE">morphed</EVENT> from the curiosity they were for much of <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="0001">the 20th century</TIMEX3> into an important new force on key committees and legislation.

A record nine women now <EVENT eid="e506" class="OCCURRENCE">lead</EVENT> committees, including some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which <EVENT eid="e507" class="OCCURRENCE">dispenses</EVENT> billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly <EVENT eid="e508" class="OCCURRENCE">dominated</EVENT> by men. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is <EVENT eid="e509" class="OCCURRENCE">charged</EVENT> with <EVENT eid="e510" class="OCCURRENCE">shaping</EVENT> the Democratic strategy in the fiscal <EVENT eid="e511" class="OCCURRENCE">battle dominating</EVENT> Capitol Hill.

One of the biggest bills to <EVENT eid="e512" class="OCCURRENCE">pass</EVENT> the Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="2012">last year</TIMEX3> was farm legislation <EVENT eid="e513" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who <EVENT eid="e514" class="OCCURRENCE">presides</EVENT> over the agriculture committee. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, <EVENT eid="e515" class="OCCURRENCE">shepherded</EVENT> the highway bill.

"We are <EVENT eid="e516" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in number," <EVENT eid="e517" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. "But more importantly, we are <EVENT eid="e518" class="OCCURRENCE">growing</EVENT> in our power. When I first <EVENT eid="e519" class="ASPECTUAL">started</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="2007">just six years ago</TIMEX3>, it was unusual to have a woman <EVENT eid="e520" class="OCCURRENCE">managing</EVENT> a bill."

Just as important, even male senators <EVENT eid="e521" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT>, is the potential the women <EVENT eid="e522" class="OCCURRENCE">hold</EVENT> for <EVENT eid="e523" class="OCCURRENCE">changing</EVENT> the tenor of the Senate and <EVENT eid="e524" class="OCCURRENCE">pushing</EVENT> for <EVENT eid="e525" class="OCCURRENCE">compromise</EVENT> in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

"I don't <EVENT eid="e526" class="I_STATE">want</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e527" class="OCCURRENCE">generalize</EVENT>, because this isn't true of all of them, but they tend to be interested in <EVENT eid="e528" class="OCCURRENCE">finding</EVENT> common ground," <EVENT eid="e529" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. "So I <EVENT eid="e530" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> it's going to have, and is having, a positive <EVENT eid="e531" class="OCCURRENCE">impact</EVENT> on the Senate."

While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have <EVENT eid="e532" class="ASPECTUAL">begun</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e533" class="OCCURRENCE">crack</EVENT> away at the gridlock by <EVENT eid="e534" class="OCCURRENCE">forming</EVENT> coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, <EVENT eid="e535" class="OCCURRENCE">led</EVENT> the repeal in the Senate of "don't <EVENT eid="e536" class="OCCURRENCE">ask</EVENT>, don't <EVENT eid="e537" class="REPORTING">tell</EVENT>" in <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e538" class="OCCURRENCE">allowing</EVENT> gay men and women to <EVENT eid="e539" class="OCCURRENCE">serve</EVENT> openly in the military.

<TIMEX3 tid="t88" type="DATE" value="2013">This year</TIMEX3>, all four of the female Senate Republicans <EVENT eid="e540" class="OCCURRENCE">split</EVENT> with their party and <EVENT eid="e541" class="OCCURRENCE">voted</EVENT> with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which had <EVENT eid="e542" class="OCCURRENCE">lapsed</EVENT> during the last Congress.
