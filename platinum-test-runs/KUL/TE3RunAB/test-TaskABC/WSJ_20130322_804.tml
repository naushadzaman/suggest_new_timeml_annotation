<TITLE>Health Insurers Warn on Premiums</TITLE>



<TEXT>

Health insurers are privately <EVENT eid="e683" class="I_ACTION">warning</EVENT> brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could <EVENT eid="e684" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> sharply <TIMEX3 tid="t109" type="DATE" value="2014">next year</TIMEX3> because of the health-care overhaul law, with the nation's biggest firm <EVENT eid="e685" class="REPORTING">projecting</EVENT> that rates could more than <EVENT eid="e686" class="OCCURRENCE">double</EVENT> for some consumers <EVENT eid="e687" class="OCCURRENCE">buying</EVENT> their own plans.

The projections, <EVENT eid="e688" class="OCCURRENCE">made</EVENT> in sessions with brokers and agents, <EVENT eid="e689" class="OCCURRENCE">provide</EVENT> some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might <EVENT eid="e690" class="OCCURRENCE">increase</EVENT> prices when major provisions of the law kick in <TIMEX3 tid="t110" type="DATE" value="2014">next year</TIMEX3> - a subject of rigorous <EVENT eid="e691" class="OCCURRENCE">debate</EVENT>.

The projected <EVENT eid="e692" class="OCCURRENCE">increases</EVENT> are at odds with what the Obama Administration <EVENT eid="e693" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> consumers should be <EVENT eid="e694" class="I_STATE">expecting</EVENT> overall in terms of cost. The Department of Health and Human Services <EVENT eid="e695" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> that the law will "<EVENT eid="e696" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> health-care coverage more affordable and accessible," <EVENT eid="e697" class="I_ACTION">pointing</EVENT> to a <TIMEX3 tid="t111" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that <EVENT eid="e698" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower.

The gulf between the pricing <EVENT eid="e699" class="OCCURRENCE">talk</EVENT> from some insurers and the government projections <EVENT eid="e700" class="I_ACTION">suggests</EVENT> how complicated the law's effects will be. Carriers will be <EVENT eid="e701" class="OCCURRENCE">filing</EVENT> proposed prices with regulators over <TIMEX3 tid="t112" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the next few months</TIMEX3>.

Part of the murkiness <EVENT eid="e702" class="OCCURRENCE">stems</EVENT> from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will <EVENT eid="e703" class="I_ACTION">help</EVENT> lower-income consumers defray costs, but they are generally not included in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be <EVENT eid="e704" class="OCCURRENCE">getting</EVENT> more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The effects of the law will <EVENT eid="e705" class="OCCURRENCE">vary</EVENT> widely, and insurers and other analysts <EVENT eid="e706" class="I_ACTION">agree</EVENT> that some consumers and small businesses will likely <EVENT eid="e707" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> premiums <EVENT eid="e708" class="OCCURRENCE">go</EVENT> down.

<EVENT eid="e709" class="ASPECTUAL">Starting</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="DATE" value="2014">next year</TIMEX3>, the law will <EVENT eid="e710" class="I_ACTION">block</EVENT> insurers from <EVENT eid="e711" class="OCCURRENCE">refusing</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e712" class="OCCURRENCE">sell</EVENT> coverage or <EVENT eid="e713" class="OCCURRENCE">setting</EVENT> premiums based on people's health histories, and will <EVENT eid="e714" class="OCCURRENCE">reduce</EVENT> their ability to <EVENT eid="e715" class="OCCURRENCE">set</EVENT> rates based on age. That can <EVENT eid="e716" class="OCCURRENCE">raise</EVENT> coverage prices for younger, healthier consumers, while <EVENT eid="e717" class="OCCURRENCE">reining</EVENT> them in for older, sicker ones. The rules can also <EVENT eid="e718" class="STATE">affect</EVENT> small businesses, which sometimes <EVENT eid="e719" class="OCCURRENCE">pay</EVENT> premiums <EVENT eid="e720" class="OCCURRENCE">tied</EVENT> to employees' health status and claims history.
