<TEXT>

President Barack Obama <EVENT eid="e344" class="OCCURRENCE">arrived</EVENT> in refugee-flooded Jordan on <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">Friday</TIMEX3> after <EVENT eid="e345" class="OCCURRENCE">scoring</EVENT> a diplomatic <EVENT eid="e346" class="OCCURRENCE">coup</EVENT> just before <EVENT eid="e347" class="OCCURRENCE">leaving</EVENT> Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <EVENT eid="e348" class="OCCURRENCE">apologized</EVENT> to Turkey for a <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> commando <EVENT eid="e349" class="OCCURRENCE">raid</EVENT> that <EVENT eid="e350" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla.

The apology, long <EVENT eid="e351" class="I_ACTION">sought</EVENT> by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, <EVENT eid="e352" class="OCCURRENCE">eased</EVENT> strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East.

It <EVENT eid="e353" class="OCCURRENCE">happened</EVENT> in a phone call to Erdogan during a final <EVENT eid="e354" class="OCCURRENCE">meeting</EVENT> between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">minutes</TIMEX3> before Air Force One <EVENT eid="e355" class="OCCURRENCE">departed</EVENT> for Jordan to <EVENT eid="e356" class="OCCURRENCE">complete</EVENT> the president's Middle East swing. It is the first foreign <EVENT eid="e357" class="OCCURRENCE">trip</EVENT> of his second <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2013-03-22">term</TIMEX3>.

A statement from Netanyahu's office <EVENT eid="e358" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the apology included an <EVENT eid="e359" class="OCCURRENCE">offer</EVENT> of compensation. However, there was confusion later when the Israeli government <EVENT eid="e360" class="OCCURRENCE">dropped</EVENT> a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a <EVENT eid="e361" class="OCCURRENCE">return</EVENT> of ambassadors.

There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would <EVENT eid="e362" class="ASPECTUAL">resume</EVENT> the joint military exercises that were <EVENT eid="e363" class="ASPECTUAL">suspended</EVENT> after the flotilla <EVENT eid="e364" class="OCCURRENCE">raid</EVENT>.

Turkey had been <EVENT eid="e365" class="OCCURRENCE">prosecuting</EVENT> four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially <EVENT eid="e366" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> the two leaders <EVENT eid="e367" class="I_ACTION">agreed</EVENT> to the <EVENT eid="e368" class="OCCURRENCE">cancellation</EVENT> of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement <EVENT eid="e369" class="OCCURRENCE">omitted</EVENT> that <EVENT eid="e370" class="OCCURRENCE">action</EVENT> as well.
